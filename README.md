* Synerpy v0.0.0
** A toolkit for the analysis of synergies in motor control and motor neuroscience

Broadly speaking, the word synergy is used to define the existence of significant covariation between elements of the motor ensemble, although the exact definition varies between authors. Synerpy, while still nascent, aims to offer a single resource for the use of the myriad analytical techniques used within the analysis of synergies.

At the moment, synerpy only hosts a few utilities for the analysis of motor unit and force data. Examples are soon to follow.

# Why a single package?
1. Transparency. The use of a sigle, citable package allows for reproduction of results and is aligned with best scientific practice.
2. Ease. It is (theoretically) possible to recreate every analytical technique from the papers within which they are presented.
3. Interpretability. A single repository offers a space for the community of motor control & motor neuroscience researchers to discuss analytical techniques, and for the code to evolve with the field.
