# Synerpy
A toolkit for the analysis of synergies in motor control and motor neuroscience

Broadly speaking, the word synergy is used to define the existence of significant covariation between elements of the motor ensemble, although the exact definition varies between authors. Synerpy offers the perspective developed in the motor control lab at PSU.

Use cases for this repository are fairly stereotyped and perhaps uniquely local to this lab environment.

Those interested in the uncontrolled manifold analysis should consult [the UCM repository](https://github.com/JoeRicotta/ucm).
